# NQueens

This was one of my first Python projects and it was my attempt to solve the N-queens problem.

The original challenge consists in placing 8 queens on a regular 8x8 chess board, but I made it so it is possible to edit the size and increase the number of queens to place,
increasing the complexity of the problem.

I have also created a super simple GUI to visualise the solutions and go through all of them.
